cardforge
=========

Project Summary
Back in the summer of 2010, I began to work on an open source Magic the Gathering simulator project called CardForge. I am a Magic addict, I’ve been playing it since middle school back in 2002. My first set that I bought was Judgement.
Anyways, I thought why not develop something I have a passion in? So I looked up the project, which was hosted on Google Code at the time, joined the forums, and became an active contributer, with the committer name xitongzou.

Technologies Used
CardForge is entirely Java-based and uses Maven for building and dependency management. The simulator currently cannot simulate multiplayer nor 100% optimal AI actions due to the interactions of MTG’s 10000+ cards, but it has a deck editor and a decent single player practice mode.

Responsibilities/Roles
I implemented about 60 of my favorite cards, including Bloodfire Colossus and Molten Hydra.

Project Details
Since the project is open source, I can divulge some of the implementation of the cards. The Card.java file is very big, and contains all the different abilities of each creature.
